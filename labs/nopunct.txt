When a program asks to read or print text without specifying a particular source or destination its input
comes from something called the standard input  its output goes to the standard output Ordinarily the
standard input is the keyboard and the standard output is the screen But you can redirect them using the
characters  and  in shell commands In this case we are asking the shell to connect tr’s standard input
to the file named summary and to connect its standard output to a new file named nopunct
