# BERKELEY-CS61A

A repository containing my journey of learning the online archived material CS61 "structure and interpretation of computer programs" http://wla.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp11/, offered at Berkeley University of California spring 2011.

It assembles all the assignments, projects, labs and midterm exams.
You can also find my attempts of solving exercises in the book "structure and interpretation of computer programs" by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman.
