# BERKELEY-CS61A

A repository documenting my journey of learning the online archived material of CS61A "structure and interpretation of computer programs" http://wla.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp11/, offered at Berkeley University of California on spring 2011.

It assembles all the assignments, projects, labs and midterm exam samples.
You can also find my attempts of solving the exercises in the book "structure and interpretation of computer programs" by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html.

All the exercises and assignments are implemented using the functionnal programming language Scheme, which is a dialect of Lisp.
